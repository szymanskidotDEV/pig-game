                <h1>GAME RULES:</h1>
                <p>The game has 2 players, playing in rounds</p>
                <p>In each turn, a player rolls 2 dices as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score</p>
                <p>BUT, if the player rolls a 1 at least in one dice, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn</p>
                <p>The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn</p>
                <p>The first player to reach 100 points (final score by default is 100) on GLOBAL score wins the game, players can change the "final score" during the game</p>
                <p>A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls in one dice a 6, 2 times in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn.</p>
